Hi, my name is Tony M. I am a visually impaired software engineer specializing in Machine Learning. I don't rely on eyesight in my work and I use NVDA screenreader exclusively.

I am planning to share  tips and tricks that I find useful in my work - hopefully they might help other visually impaired people to use computer  more effectively.
