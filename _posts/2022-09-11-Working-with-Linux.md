# Working with Linux using NVDA

## Scenarios

We will look at two possible scenarios of working with Linux environment:
* WSL or WSL2 are solutions developed by Microsoft that allow you to run virtual Linux environment on your Windows computer. They are really good if you want to learn Linux or when you need to use some Linux commands on Windows.
* Connecting to a remote Linux server via SSH. This would allow you to work with real Linux servers and typically this would be required in most industrial jobs these days.
